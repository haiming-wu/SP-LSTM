i bought the previous model of this dehydrator . i seriously would not even give this machine 1 star , but there is no lower rating . i bought mine a year ago , used it once , and the bottom heating element burned every single tray that i rotated to the bottom , which you have to do in order to get anywhere . the entire machine was worthless within a week of me owning it . i did eat the beef jerky , but that was the most expensive jerky i will ever make ! i called immediately to complain , talked to a guy named saul , who said the unit must be defective , duh ! and he would send me a new unit and a return authorization . i have gotten neither , i am just out the money . i have called back , faxed , mailed , waited on hold , and finally decided that ronco products are crap . i will never give him or his company another cent . buyers please research your purchases , i see from other reviews that i am not the only one with a complaint . buy a different machine ||| 0
i spent about 20 minutes trying to ascertain how much this item cost , but to no avail whatsoever ! i 'm so frustrated after such a lengthy , yet futile search that i want to hurt someone ! instead , i 'm shutting down my browser . you idiots should think about how many more sales you 'd make if you just included a price , for god 's sake ! ||| 0

it really does make a difference when some of the chlorine is filtered out of your coffee ( and even more so in your bourbon ) water , but these filters are a rip off price-wise . it 's hard to believe braun would n't make money selling them at a third of the price ||| 1
i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address . it worked for two days and then it stopped . on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour , but it only worked intermittently . she did n't keep the receipt so i 'm writing it off as a waste of money . when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense . you can see when they are empty and you do n't have to keep up with batteries . i do n't buy the argument that the hands-free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands ||| 0
i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas . i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use . some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans . maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them . the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly . i feel we made a good choice ||| 1

i have used this vacuum for over a year now . i consistently have trouble with the belts staying on . i can not count the number of times i 've had to unscrew the plate underneath and reattach the belts . if it even rolls over something uneven on the floor , the belt comes off and the beater brush stops moving . also , although `` bagless '' sounded great , this vacuum is very , very messy to clean out . i have to take it outdoors and the dust goes everywhere . it also does not have a lot of sucking power through the attachments . i write this review today because the beater bar stopped turning and all belts are attached . i have taken this vacuum apart for the last time.. ||| 0
this fan is incredibly powerful . it can definitely move air around a room . my one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium . i do n't know if it 's just mine that is that way or not and it is n't a big deal since i bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and i 'll tell ya , when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse ||| 1
i 've owned one of these for about a month . it 's a total waste of money . it rarely sprays , just a steady stream of oil . i 'm diabetic and thought this would be a good way to restrict my use of oil on salads , etc . i am so very disappointed ... ... i 'll try to find another brand that is more reliable and that does what it 's advertised ||| 0
do not buy the shark portable steamer under any circumstances . the trigger mechanism is defective and fails after a few uses , causing all of the steam to leak out uncontrollably , which is also exposes the user to a possible steam burn . euro-pro operating llc does not stand behind its products . they will not sell you a replacement trigger or hose assembly if it fails ( and trust me , it will fail ) . instead , euro-pro wants you to spend $ 40 ( $ 12.95 shipping + $ 27.00 `` minimum '' repair charge ) to even look at it . replacement parts are an additional charge ! i can buy a competing product for the cost of euro-pro 's `` minimum repair '' charge , shipping charge , + parts charge . euro-pro 's service after the sale stinks . i will not buy shark products or do business with euro-pro operating llc ever again . ||| 0

i love the sango nova brown dishware and rate it 5 stars . this boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight . the slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer 's comments . mine too arrived broken . sure seems like sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box . amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping . i sure hope amazon gets credit from sango for all these broken pieces . combined score +2 ||| 0

i hated these shakers . i got them as a gift and 1. they are too big and take up too much space and 2. the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3. the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once . finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out . the other , smaller fiesta ware ones -- the round ones -- are much much better ||| 0

cuts like a samurai blade quality , and does n't need to steel as frequent as the henckels/ wusthof knives . it has excellent weight for a medium sized hand . however , the handles get quite slippery when wet , so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety . also , if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel , do n't , because this global blade is much harder than the henckels/wusthof blades ; a qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must , or if you really like the steel design , get the global steel which can cost quite a bit . overall , this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed , just like a samurai would do to get use to his sword ||| 1
this pillow looks simple enough , but there must have been a lot of research put into inventing it ! the dogbone ( medium size , about 16 '' w -- i do n't remember specific dimensions ) instantly relieved many aches i had in my neck without forcing me to lie down in a flat position ( which often gives me a headache and makes it impossible to read while lying down ) . i 'd been to the doc quite a few times for the back/neck problems i 've had lately , but no rx worked quite as well as this delightful cushion . my only issues with it are cleaning ( stuffing 's packed very tight , so i 'd rather not try it out in the washer for fear of mold/mildew ; i spray it with disinfectant every once in a while instead ) the outer material ( an optional moisture-wicking or allergen-reducing pillowcase would be nice ) . however , i bought it based on earlier reviews , and i do n't regret it ||| 1
it seems that there is always something crappy in a good design . the pot does a good job perking coffee , but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot . i think that melitta should send out , for nothing the glass top . i am like the other reviews , i would not buy another melitta product unless they make good on this pot . there is a danger of the top blowing out and melitta could be in for law suits ||| 0
sure , it looks nice enough without anything on it . but if you plan to actually hang coats and umbrellas on it , pick something else . it 's tippy and it does n't hold very many coats without the pegs cracking and breaking off . it 's cheap , but you 're getting less than what you pay for . it could n't last a winter when being used by only two people ||| 0
i bought a blue one . the mug looks nice enough , but it cracked the first time i filled it with hot water for tea . get your act together guys -- it really is not so difficult to make dishes that can withstand a little heat . as for the claim that this can go in the microwave ... after the mug cracked , i did n't bother to try ||| 0

the filter model i have , 18150 , requires two of these with no foam spacers . two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously . however , i 'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall , maybe slightly less . the cover still goes on , but not as far down as it should . as for filtering , i estimate that it filters the same as the previous . the `` permanence '' of this filter makes me wonder why i 've been replacing the previous style , since i can see no difference in the filter material ||| 1
this is essentially the all-clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles . the `` dutch oven '' sold by all-clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1/2 quart saucier . this is a versatile stovetop pan -- wide enough for frying , deep enough for liquids , good-looking enough to carry to the table . it can also slide into the oven when needed . it may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet , with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans , as one poster complained , but it functions quite well as an `` everyday pan '' for up to 4 persons . the dimensions of 9 1/2 inches by 3 inches ( plus handles ) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape , with a rounded bottom for easy stirring . if you are looking for a versatile `` do-it-all '' pan , this is a good choice ||| 1

i bought this item based on price , how can you go wrong for 10 $ for a programable coffee maker ? well , you get what you pay for . after having this coffee pot for only 3 weeks , it just stopped working ! just to ship it back would have been the cost of the item ! based on the rest of the reviews , i just threw away and went out and bought a mr. coffee . lesson learned . treehous ||| 0
somehow i stumbled onto this item while searching for `` quiet '' and `` fan '' . now that i review the item description i do n't see any mention of `` quiet '' . oops . the fan 's primary flaw is that it only has two speeds , both of which are insanely high . i do n't need such a mighty wind to just take the edge off of my over-heated workspace . a gentle breeze would be great . instead i have a choice between either a hurricane or a tornado . on the bright side , perhaps this product will bring about a resurgence of interest in the paper weight . and then , one day , frustrated over my choices between a sweltering office or a deafeningly loud fan , i can grab my largest paper weight and use it to break a window , thereby cooling the office naturally . everyone wins ! also , while the fan looks identical to the holmes fan pictured , it is branded as a `` westpointe '' . really . `` westpointe '' with two `` e '' s ||| 0
first of all , it 's expensive ( $ 60 ) . kitchen kaboodle sells the same exact one for $ 29.99 . i tried to return it to the company and found out they 're located in canada so it was going to cost me another $ 25.00 for shipping . due to shipping , i was forced to keep it . huge rip off ! ! it is good quality but go to kitchen kaboodle for half the cost ! ||| 0

i bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box . first , the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy , and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back . there was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance . finally , it is just not good looking at all ... extremely cheap in appearance . it did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to amazon . i went with the bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers . evidently , another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances . do not buy this item ! ! ! ! get the braun kf550-bk aromadeluxe instead ||| 0

i wanted to dress up my kitchen a little , and this does the trick ( makes me not dread washing the dishes . an added plus ! ) . it 's a nice cherry red , and i 'm a bit of a `` red junkie . '' i gave this five stars because it 's perfect for my needs . if you have a large family and tons of dishes it 's going to be on the small side though . the red colander 's a great extra , as is the little sponge holder ( it has suction cups to keep it in place , but mine does n't seem to stay stuck . that 's a minor detail , though , and it could have more to do with my kitchen 's tiling than the suction cups ) . one thing to note -- if your sink 's drains are n't centered you might be annoyed with the hole in the middle of the rubber sink mat . overall , this is a durable and nice to look at sinkware set . what more could we want ? ||| 1
this machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well . the fan is very quiet . i like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well . my only complaint is that the blue lcd that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is very bright . too bright for a bedroom . really lights it up . i 'll be looking for some way of safely masking it . otherwise very nice but hope it lasts ||| 1
this is a big saucepan ! i got it for christmas because i needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines . this has become my favorite pot for many things ; from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night . the see-through lid is great for monitoring food as it 's cooking , and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring . it is traditional calphalon quality with a modern look , and i love it ||| 1

this product is a must have for anyone serious about baking . this mixer is by far the best appliance that i have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course . i reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake . the 5 quart + was worth the money , do n't buy the 4 qt , save the money and purchase the 5 , you 'll be glad that you did ||| 1
i bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office . i was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it . i 'd looked at the small haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior . i broke a lot of rules setting this up . its not connected to the hot water supply , since i have a very old sink and the only other connection i had was to cold water lines . also , the machine is on the floor , under the sink . i bought new hoses to make the connections . luckily , the standard connectors on the back made this easy - the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line , and the drain can take a piece of garden hose . i was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water , but so far its been okay . ( if i was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home , i might not be so nonchalant . ) my unit was used , from an area where there was very hard water , and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine . i soaked everything in clr to remove the scale from the sump grill , the heating element and the wash arm , and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal , and away we went . since we are in an office , we always use the sanitary wash to keep the cooties down . the machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot , and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over , if you pop the door open . the machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink . one reason i avoided the plastic tub haier is noise . if you load this machine carefully , you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much , and the machine will operate more quietly . we 've found that we can run the machine , have the office radio on , and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble . my only complaints would be that on occasion , the timer has gotten stuck ( once or twice in 100 washes ) . also , some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater . capacity is very decent , probably because the machine is pretty large . measure first ||| 1

it 's a three-piece roasting rack -- two sides and a long `` pin '' that holds them together . when assembled it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles . it 's supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey , and after using it with a 22 lb turkey i believe that claim . the tall sides and handles make it easy to remove your turkey from your roasting pan , and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage the way angled racks do . in fact , my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our maxam steel roaster , which is currently my favorite roasting pan . the truly cool thing about this rack , however , is n't the handles or the shape . it 's that nifty pin at the bottom . you see , you just put your racked turkey down on its carving platter and pull the pin , then you simply remove the sides . that 's it . they pull right away from the turkey , leaving it behind on its platter . no more trying to lever it out of your pan or off of its rack ; it 's right where you want it already . for all of its non-stick properties the rack did take some real elbow-grease to clean -- particularly when trying to get turkey goo out of the crevices between bars -- but that is n't very surprising . it does make it unfortunate that the dishwasher is not recommended for this product , however . also , there is one problem that did bother us ; it seems that some of the non-stick coating at the bottom of the rack flaked off during cooking . we thought that perhaps the initial 30 minutes at 500 f was too high a temperature for the rack , but there is no maximum temperature listed on the packaging that i could find . i 'm still giving this item a rating of four because it 's just so incredibly cool an idea , and so remarkably useful , but i have to admit that i 'm not thrilled with the idea of a non-stick coating that flakes , and i wish the item was dishwasher-safe . i 'd love to see cuisipro develop a version of this item made out of a better material ||| 1
i bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning , and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day . this is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves . some of the honeycombs get a little crushed , but i 've found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them . reese 's puffs and cheerios also came out without any crushing . you have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh . maybe this was in the directions , but i missed it and learned the hard way . but the kids figured out the caps easily and it 's not a big deal for them ||| 1
i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it . it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved . i definitely recommend it . i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special . ||| 1
i have purchased several espresso machines and sampled scores more , francis francis being my first . this machine is better than the 200 coffee maker labelled as `` espresso '' machines but marginally . if you are a serious espresso drinker you know that the quality and cutting of the bean and the quality of the machine are equally important . focusing on the machine for a moment . you need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee . a truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste . this machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans . the espresso extracted is thus poor in taste . if you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra . you will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results . the cheap pods really limit the different beans one can try and the cutting of the beans are fixed ||| 0

i just purchased this vacuum this morning and vacuumed the entire house ... and now i am afraid that i have to return it back to the store . it sucks wonderfully , do n't get me wrong . the reason why it 's got to be returned to targetland is because of 1. the noise 2. the `dust that flies out of the dust cup when you 're emptying it . the noise is certainly the loudest i 've ever heard on a vacuum cleaner . but , i thought , hey , that 's okay if you want to be noisy ... until i ventured into cleaning the stairs . there 's not much of an extension between the cleaning wand/brush and the actual machine , so while i was bending over to suck up hair and debris ( what have you ) from the stairs ' carpet , i had the crazy noise blasting `` turbo '' -style directly into my ear . ( this was done 15 minutes ago , and my ear still hurts ) . the other problem i 've found with the vacuum is the point that while emptying the dust cup , i am having to actually touch dirt and dust ( the entire outside of the cup is coated with it ) . while pouring the dirt into the trash can , a bit of dirt and dust fall onto the floor ... nasty and what 's the point in the dust cup if this happens ? i had a eureka spin brush vacuum contraption most recently ( it died after 2 1/2 years ) and i know from that experience that the dirt and dust should not be coating the cup , nor falling to the floor . so , alas , my friends , i must pack up this marvel and take it back to the store . mayhaps , i 'll have luck with a vacuum cleaner that uses bags ( you know , the old-fashioned kind ) ||| 0

i got the expensive one rather than the $ 14.99 aroma cooker , thinking it will be better quality . wrong . i only used it twice , not only the rice get burn , after i clean in and out of the cooker , it still look dirty . the quality of the material was really bad . i think the store where i got this products knows the problem that they take my return even it past 15 days requirement . do not waste your good earned money on this one . ||| 0
i was excited when i read the great reviews for this product , but i was very dissapointed when i received it . i wanted this because i live in an apartment complex where i have to carry my laundry some distance to the laundry room . i thought it would be great to just be able to wheel it over with this . however , when i tried to put it together out of the box ( it requires complete assembly ) , though it is simple to put together , not one of the small screws that hold the top bars on to the unit fit ! all four will go half-way in and no further . perhaps i got a faulty unit , but i see it falling apart soon because of this . also , the bag itself seems flimsy . i was also happy when i read that this rolls quietly , however , they must have been rolling it on carpet because out on the concrete walkway that leads to the laundry room , it is extemely noisy - i ended up carrying anyway so as not to disturb my neighbors . the only thing this unit has going for it is it looks nice and holds a surprisingly large amount of laundry . if you are just using this in your home , it might work well for you , but if you need to take it out to a laundry facility , go with something else ||| 0

i wish i had gotten one of these a long time ago . easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses . my wife can even use it without burning stuff - which she admits is a feat for her - so she uses it several times a week too . it holds heat well , cleans up easy , and the lip on the corner works great for draining . only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove - with gas you should be fine . it has n't seemed to effect the performance though , and for the money it is quite perfect ||| 1
read the info about this product carefully . this listing is not for kitchen scissors , but rather poultry shears . chef 's choice does make the 8 '' kitchen scissors in the picture , but that is not what you will get if you order these . i had these on my wishlist and my brother ordered them for me for christmas . i am now returning the poultry shears to amazon ||| 0

this is by far the best toaster we 've ever owned . it does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional , so i do n't know how it works yet , but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side . a fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation . the bagels we toasted in it were just perfect ! the microwave is large enough inside for my purposes , which are usually just reheating foods and defrosting . i never use microwave popcorn so i ca n't say how well it does in that area , but the frozen burrito i cooked last night came out terrific . regarding the comment one reviewer said about it not being space saving , i think what the company is referring to is the fact that , while the unit itself might have somewhat of a large footprint , it eliminates the need to have a separate toaster . this does indeed save space , not to mention an electrical outlet . overall , i 'm very pleased with it , but have n't had it long enough to speak to its longevity . i can tell you that it 's almost worth buying for the toaster alone ||| 1

bought this vacuum because consumer reports picked it as one of the 2006 best buys . better than dyson or rainbow . this is our second eureka , but this one is significantly better than the last . the last was a bagless model , and this one uses bags , and as a result it 's much easier to clean . bags are quite inexpensive , so it only adds about $ 10-15 per year ( 6-9 bags ) . suction is fantastic . noise is low . it 's easy to use . and i will add that we purchased a `` refurbished '' model , but we can identify no defects or differences . looks perfectly new and runs great . so the choice is yours : dyson for $ 400+ or this one which is better for $ 99 ? ? ||| 1
this is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone . i am not in the habit of writing reviews , but this juicer earns it . perhaps you are like me , and have never used a juicer before . you want to get one without taking out a small loan , because you just do n't know if your that into it . if so , this is your juicer . there are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting . i just want to back those up with my experience . this is a good , strong product ||| 1
i 've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning . we 've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water ! it 's a great saucepan and the price was great . highly recommended ||| 1
light is beautiful and functional , and so great for traveling , but first led light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months . too bad . ||| 0
i actually purchased this book light so that i can read while i wait for my child to sleep . he likes me to be in the room . this was perfect . does not put out enough light to bother my son , but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while i wait for him to fall asleep ||| 1
i received great customer service and a beautiful plant here . i would recommend this gardenia to anyone who loves flowers or wants to give a nice gift . my gardenia was delivered right on time in great condition , is still very healthy , and smells terrific . i 've gotten many compliments from friends and even my grandchild who said `` what smells so good grandma ? ||| 1

i received the sleepwarmer blanket last week and have been very disapointed -- it is just not warm enough ! ! even on the highest setting it does n't get warm enough initially . it is fine for keeping warm during the night but i want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does . it is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well . not worth the money at all ||| 0
not the best sheet experience . my legs broke out in a rash . best to wash before using , i guess . the thread count is a bit lacking , too . for microfiber sheets , i want a cloud-like surface . i will go for a higher priced item next time ||| 0
like the other reviewers , it would be nice if the plastic was metal ... but i love this little thing ! i usually have tons of honey everywhere . just put a little hot water in the base , let sit for a few minutes and it pours out great ! so easy that even my little kids can use it without making too much mess ||| 1
i ordered this table based on the reviews i read and boy i will never do that again . this table is such poor quality and is not worth the money . i am so disappointed in it that i shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it . it is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy . i would say this table is worth $ 20 and no more ... ... ... .. ||| 0
it 's a wonderful cutting board ( also available at the store ) i 'm a bartender and chef and can honestly say this is something i 've found very useful . any good chef knows you need two cutting boards one wood and one of a polyethylene or resistant plastic . this one really lives up to the description and works well for mulitple tasks . the $ 9.99 price tag is n't bad at all for the cutting size and it hides the knife marks very well . that , and it just looks great in the kitchen . i use boards like this in my restaurant all the time and would n't go without them . do n't listen to the idiot who thought he could buy a 14 x 17 solid granite cutting board for ten bucks , not that a rock cutting board is worth anything as it would ruin your knives . fyi to the moron - amp ; quot ; protect your countertops from scratches with these lightweight , tough , polyethylene cutting boards.amp ; quot ; yah , nothing at all ... dimwit ||| 1
the pot rack was just the right size and color . it looks great in my kitchen without creating a barrier between my kitchen and dining room . i love how easy it was to hang and the number of links provided with it mean that it can hang really low if i want . this is just perfect for my kitchen ||| 1
a beautiful pan from kitchenaid . i use it for everything and the lid is a big bonus . think of it as a 10 '' skillet you use everyday , which can also go into the oven , and also be used for serving . quality and heft is better than all clad ||| 1
this is a significant improvement over the 750 model . the 750 model was not very well designed . the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic . we returned this . we got the 760 to replace that . the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem . for the same price as the 750 , the 760 comes with one extra bowl , juicer and egg whisk . compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed . ||| 1
i internet shopped for a week , reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made . i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did . i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast , easy job . ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly . it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power . i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal , the pitcher is thick , solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless . i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 , yes just 2 speeds . i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used , they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons . the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous . ||| 1
this is an incredibly beautiful knife , with an excellent weight . well-balanced . the damascus steel is just so nice . my husband had been drooling over this knife and we received it as a wedding present from a very generous relative . this is our third expensive kitchen knife and i would say that in terms of general use -- meat to vegetables -- this is my second favorite , with my large , 8 '' henckel being my best knife . the shun is much nicer than the wusthof prix ii , which sports the comparable santoku shape . my complaint has much to do with the design and that is that the blade is set at an angle , making this a much better knife for filleting motions , of which i do few . it 's marketed toward general chopping and slicing , but i find that slant makes my cuts less precise . it 's still my husband 's favorite , but since i 'm the one who does the majority of the cooking , i 'd still rate it four out of five in comparison to similarly excellent brands . but it 's a real marvel to behold and i love the high quality of the wooden base and that lovely steel ||| 1
my son is a star wars nut and just loves this blanket ||| 1
i have watched emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter . i just dismissed it as part of emeril 's shtick until i bought this machine for myself . the first time i tried to use it with any liquid ingredients ( making mayonnaise ) , it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl . the top is just flawed in its design , as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl . i suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that ka did , much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews ( e. g. consumer reports and cook 's illustrated ) . in any case , this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry ( they blow through the badly designed joint as well ) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter , the outside of the bowl , the bottom of the machine , and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do . i will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the cuisinart i have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard . ||| 0
ok well unlike the other reviewers , i hate this ice cream scoop . yes , it 's heavy and seems to be well-engineered . however , i do n't like the somewhat square shape of the handle and have a hard time getting a good grip on it . and as another reviewer already mentioned , it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed . when i 'm scooping the ice cream , the water drips out and down the handle , thus making it even harder to grip the handle . it makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and i get ice cream all over my hand . i have a cheap $ 2 plastic scoop that i bought when i was in college , and i prefer it to this one . ||| 0
if i could give half a star i would . i had this unit for exactly 93 days and it just wouldnt turn on one day . i used it less than 3 times a week . there are several drawbacks to this unit . it draws alot of electricity to run it . i could use the same socket to run anything else while this on . water gurgles/spits out of the spout while its boiling and i have gotten burned . the spout is also poorly designed , the water does n't come out in an even stream , it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid . the heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean . the water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it . i just bought the braun wk200b about a week ago . it is everything this kettle is n't and so much more . read the reviews on that one before you buy this one . its a better choice all around . save the shipping costs , time headache , just buy the braun first and pass this one up . ||| 0
we received the zephyr as a wedding gift . ours is a little newer design than what is shown in the photo . the handle on ours is brass instead of chrome . it heats fast and holds plenty of water for several cups of tea or cup-o-noodle . much nicer than some of the higher priced tea kettles out there . my wife and i are very pleased with this tea kettle ||| 1
the krups xp 2070 has been in use at my household for about a month now , with no problems to speak of . we use the espresso machine with cappucino attachment almost daily , and each time it has been very good . a notice i would give to the espresso enthusiast looking to buy would be the need for a different tamper than the one provided . the provided tamper is plastic , and can be wobbly , but i am very satisfied with the product ||| 1

you may as well put your betta in a glass of water . the argument is that bettas are naturally found in rice paddies in thailand ... go ahead and google images of a rice paddy . bettas can live in small areas due to a special lung that lets them breathe air directly ... humans can live in cars , but should they ? and the tiny stick of bamboo is a joke , adding insult to injury . they have nothing to retreat or hide behind at all in this kit . bettas were not put on this earth to make your office pretty . if you want a betta , get them a proper tank ||| 0
for what this item costs you would think that the pump would last longer than 3 months . i really like foaming soap because i have three young children who have a tendency of making a huge mess with both bar and liquid soap . since there is so little actual soap in foam soap there is n't the big mess to clean . but i have a fundamental problem with paying for bottles of diluted soap . i searched high and low for an attractive foaming soap dispenser and cuisipro was about all i could find . but within 3 months the pump started to stick and i have to manually move it up and down . it 's cheaper to keep refilling the store bought soap dispensers and just buy a new one when it starts to stick . ||| 0

have owned the jura capresso e8 since july of 2006 . have made over 750 coffees since that day . heavy entertaining and daily latte 's bring value to the machine . machine has responded well under all circumstances . only problem thus far has been with the frother which would jam from the froth to steam position . contacted capresso and the expressed a new attachment . have had no additional issues with machine thus far . excellent crema and good temperature for espresso . ( warm the expresso cups before hand ) as with other machines i have owned , experimentation with coffee to milk ratio takes some time . once determined the machine makes a consistent brew each time . have run cleaning cycles and filter changes when prompted . machine really is super-automatic . the machine informs you when water is needed , when beans need to be filled and when grounds need to be emptied . would recommend the machine without hesitation . should this change i will update the review . ||| 1

this toaster oven is perfect . i have had this oven for about 6 months and had enjoyed cooking meals in the summer months without heating up the entire house . i have even cooked a whole chicken in it . this oven cooks food evenly and i have had no problems with it at all . i highly recommend this product . update . i still have this toaster oven and use it almost everyday . i still absolutely love it and do n't understand why everyone else seems to have issues with it . i do n't know what i would do with out this oven . i have owned it for over 3 years and it still works perfect . i recently cooked a prime rib in it and it turned out fabulous ||| 1
about a year ago i was looking for an espresso/cappuccino machine that would be both great in quality and easy to use . i also wanted it to look contemporary , to fit the style of other things in the house . on the other hand , i did n't want to spend a fortune for some expensive brands that run up to $ 12,000 . at that moment i was lucky enough to order from amazon breville 800jexl juice fountain elite . that juicer impressed me so much , that i was happy to buy breville 's whatever - which happened to be breville 800esxl die-cast espresso machine . it is reasonably priced for style and quality and so far i , my husband and all our guests are happy with both espresso and cappuccino . i only wish i could do more than 2 cups at the same time . a year later , i still think it was a great buy and it works as well as ever ||| 1

we too have the same issues with this that everyone else has mentioned . we already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off , nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem . now a month after using the new one , its espresso pump is loud and noisy , sounding like its broken . also for some reason or another it wo n't send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso . it ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out . but then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine . its been going for the last couple of days , but its such a iffy thing . on the plus side it does look nice ! and it does make a good tasting espresso when it does work ! my husband does agree with the directions are hard to follow , but he says that about everything ||| 0
i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine 's day party . it was the talk of the whole school . the kids loved it . i used sephra chocolate ( a coupon was included ) , so i did n't have to mess with adding any oil . the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression . the cascading , flowing , chocolate was n't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box , but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil , but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine . i also saved $ 25.00 by buying the chp ( champaigne color ) version ||| 1
i found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate . it 's a soft light ( almost seems like a natural spectrum ) and is very directed at the page . the clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover , and the neck is flexible as needed . so , functionally , it gets a solid a . but i was n't happy that it takes nonstandard batteries ( two of those round watch/calculator batteries ) . replacing them is a hassle ( though inexpensive ) because i have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before i leave , and i have to find them in a store with an electronic department . i wish this light took aaa or something . the light does include batteries , so you wo n't need to worry until you run out . for me , that was probably around 20 hours or so ||| 1

we finally broke down and went looking for a complete set of quality kitchen knives . the name wushof came up several times and we purchased a set of them . they work well until they started getting dull sooner then i thought they would . i have numerous sharpening stone , ( ceramic , diamond ) and buffing wheels , and sharpened them myself to a razors edge . again they worked well , but soon became very dull . we were very careful in the storing and handling of them which made no differance . they are well balanced , looked well made but are over rated and priced . the 2 mac japanese knives we have stay sharper longer , take abuse better and sharpen easier . ||| 0
my pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind . he jumps to pull the beas out of the hive . he squeaks the beas . perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head . he went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it . it is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads . he likes the wing detail for chewing on . this toy gives exercise . i am so glad i tried it . he plays with the hegehog on his own . those are the 2 best toys . the squirels from the hide a squirel are fun , but the game holder is not something he was really excited about . these interactive toys are great . i have never seen such excitement and tail wagging . he hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise . this one is the best . it is well worth $ 10 for a dog who loves to play . i get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys ||| 1

great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken . amazon , how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer does n't pack them well enough for shipping ? amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go . any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic . i 've received two of those lovely surprises , the first set i ordered and the replacement set . oh boy , i give up ! the canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them . just imagine the ups guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard . they break ! amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement ( in this case ) so it 's like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage . are you feeling lucky ? ? ? if so then roll the dice ||| 0
i can put up with the weight , the noise , the poorly located on-off switch , the spinning brush that is cool but does n't work . what i can not put up with is how touchy it is to put the cannister back on . it will appear to be on correctly , but if not , the dust collects in the top part of the cannister and will block suction . this creates an unmanageable mess when you try to empty the cannister . buy something else , i ca n't wait for this one to die ||| 0

we love these glasses , we have had the reidel glasses , like these , many times . . . they break so easily and ca n't go in the dishwasher . these glasses are so much more utilitarian , we use them as our everyday glasses , not just for wine . they look great , feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher , and cost so much less . we still keep the reidel on hand for special occasions , they are more refined , but i got so tired of that ultra-thin glass breaking in my hand as i attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass . i strongly recommend the libbey glasses . . . you will like it , like , like it on your table , table , table ||| 1
this stock pot is enamel on steel , not cast iron , it was never meant to be . no reason for any confusion . i 've had mine for 5 years , there are no chips or scratches . no matter what i 've made ; spaghetti sauce , posole or any kind of soup . nothing has ever burned , nor has the enamel come away from the pot . turn the heat down , i always get perfect results . lecreuset comes with a great guarantee in regards to workmanship and defects . shame on anyone who purchases cookware in this day and age and does n't follow up with the manufacturer when there is an issue such as some i 've read above ||| 1
this is just what i was looking for . i use it for the few dishes that do n't make it in to the dishwasher , but mostly for drying the baby bottles . the bottle drying systems are pretty ugly and can only be used for that purpose . this drying rack is very useful for the bottles and dishes ||| 1
i was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum . wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction . it had some of the best section power i had seen in any vacuum . so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities . its so light ... about nine pounds and easy to transport and store . its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button . the bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum . they are very easy to get at and change . its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors , along baseboards and on stairways . not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch . i have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming . this is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright . my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool . many third-party vacuum attachments would work with it too . i am glad i bought it and would recommend it . its the vacuum i would use most . the biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done . push a button and the cord automatically rewinds . whats not to like about this vacuum . highly recommended ||| 1

just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket . it is rice we have prepared numerous times in another ( cheaper ) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop . the rice that came out of the zojirushi was absolutely perfect ! as good as any i have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to china . i was astounded . none of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker , just perfect plump , fragrant rice . the countertop stayed clean as well , did n't bubble over with starch water like the other cooker . clean up of the cooker was easy . top notch , excellent product . you ca n't make better rice than what this thing produces ||| 1

as far as whisks for non-stick surfaces go , the silicone-encased wires are very flexible -- a far cry from the hard , thick plastic whisks with only a few wires . they are ideal for non-stick surfaces except for one problem . the silicone is soft and not durable . after a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer , the silicone gets easily cut . the silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose . i have been very careful , but this works out to probably $ 2 each time i used it ||| 0

i like the idea of this bundt pan . i made 3 batches of chocolate truffles on it . the recipe that comes with the pan is awesome . however , i have yet to figure out how to get the chocolates out easily . the first time , i used a non-stick spray ( not vegetable oil ) . i thought that might be my problem because the company recommends vegetable oil . on the next two batches , i poured vegetable oil in the little holes and spread it around using a pastry brush . again , i had to fight to get the chocolates out . i kid you not -- my husband pounded on the pan with a big rubber mallet to get the chocolates to come out ! i must be doing something wrong . i will call customer service tomorrow -- but if there is a trick to this , they should have told you on the instructions on how to make the truffles ! other than that , the chocolates turned out beautifully and i will use this pan again , even if i have to call my husband to help me out with his rubber mallet ||| 1

after reading reviews on the wok 's available on amazon [ .com ] , i decided on this wok due to the ability to put it in the dishwasher . turns out it is a bit to large to put in my dishwasher , but it is very easy to hand clean . the non-stick surface has lasted , but i am careful to only use plasic or wood , and i wash it with a cloth and soap . it gets to temperature quickly during cooking , the only 'complaint ' i have is the simmer cycles ( not a constant heat , but on and off ) . i purchased some thai cook books , ( real thai , and thailand the beautiful cook book ) and was amazed with the correct ingredients and a wok , how easy it is to prepare my favorite food . the difference the wok made- i was able to cook at the correct temperatures . my stove btu is apparently quite low , it took forever to 'sizzle ' so the food turned to mush before it was cooked . i now use the wok for anything i want to cook fast and/or warm up ||| 1
let me preface my review by saying that i am a 25-year-old woman who is n't really big on doing chores . i got a dyson for christmas , and just tried out the dusting brush last week . my immediate reaction was : `` this is genius ! '' it is great for dusting computers , televisions , lampshades , bookcases ( mine are unfinished wood with several crevices , so normal dusting never seemed to help ) , the tops of books , cd organizers , ceiling fan blades , metal bedframes ... i have dusted so many things with the dyson attachment , and it works beautifully . this attachment will not disappoint , trust me . it 's already made my life so much easier and cleaner ||| 1

this is a nice quality lightweight comforter . there is a discrepancy right up front in the 'product details ' that lists it as shipping weight '9.00 lbs . ' which is not the case at all . after arrival of two of them , we were shocked . when advised seller they replied after many days , said we needed to read the 'product description ' ( scroll further down on item ) which was different info from what was listed above . they did not update information on this item for customers on amazon site for 2 months.. thus the 2 stars . i should have written this review earlier . on the plus side , it is very nice quality , individual pocket stitching to keep fill in place and border piping , ideal for springtime . ||| 0
i got this for my mother and i was n't too sure about the color i had originally wanted a darker color- but this arrived and was such an excellent product ... my mother loves and when i seen it on her bed it made me want one - this is one of the best deals i have gotten on amazon .. love it ||| 1
do not buy this expecting the lid in the description ! i never recieved the lid described in the description section . they had a similar skillet in colors for less . skillet is a quality weight anodized aluminum . it has what seems to be a high quality nonstick interior . the comfort handle has a good feel and is oven safe to 450 degrees . con the cushion handle means you can not use in a broiler . no top browning your omelet in the broiler ||| 0
i love going to other peoples party 's and sharing a few drinks , but never had a good way to carry to bottles of bubbly or other drink of choice before this product . i purchased an orange one last year , and like it so much i 'm giving them as gifts this holiday season . they fit almost any round or squire 750ml bottle ( absolute , sky , captain , jose cuervo , bushmills ) . however oddly shaped bottles a bit of a tight fit , like baileys ||| 1

for an inexpensive pizza stone , it does the job . if you 're looking for something that is more versatile , look somewhere else . this stone is primarily for breads , pizza and the like . i know this because i tried baking cookies on it . the cookies turned out fine , but they stuck to the stone . however , when i make home made pizza from scratch , the crust comes out perfect ! not too soft , not too crisp . it bakes it perfectly all the way through with a nice golden crust ||| 1

well i used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts i say go for it . not bad for the price i recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic . ||| 1

i would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone . the coffee does taste funny and i did n't realize it might be the metal pot . also , do not pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out . just like one of the other reviewers said , the pot does not slide in and out easily . not a coffeemaker i would recommend . the only thing i like about it is the size ! ! ! ! ! ! ||| 0
i was looking for a timer that had a loud ringer i could hear from another room while cleaning , so i could check on what i 'm cooking.. this one just did n't do that for me . i notice the sound it sends out is not always the same.. sometimes it is a bit louder then other times..to me that does not do me much good..i can not depent on it all the time ! so now i just use it to keep near me when i 'm at the computer , but i do notice more of the sound comes out of the back , but then you ca n't see how much time you have left , if you turn it backwards ! ! ! the ringer goes for 1 min . this does not count backward . the numbers and buttons are large , which is probably the reason i bought this timer . the two magnets are not very big , and does not stay on my frig very good . when its on my frig , and i start to press the buttons , it starts moving all over . price wise , this is probably a good buy , depending on what you want to use it for . i bought another timer that the ringer is louder , but the buttons and are very small.. guess you can not have it all , no matter at what the price is ! ||| 0
this sharpener is exactly what i hoped for . i have used it enough to overcome the learning curve and am very well pleased ||| 1
i bought this as a upgrade from the glass carafe that came with my aroma control machine . i was tired of burnt coffee due to the burner burning it . this carafe keeps coffee steaming hot for hours . a great upgrade ||| 1
a good basic place to hang a half dozen jackets or hats . its a little wobbly when loaded but not too bad . easy to assemble and looks ok. a good overall buy . ||| 1
we had a heated pad for years that finally played out . it was wonderful . wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one , i bought this item . i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it . i was suspect when i opened it . poor quality material . poor bed fit . very very warm on the lowest setting . after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires , which are quite large , in my ribs -- it had to come off . i had rather be cold and i hate being cold ||| 0
2 years ago i purchased these dishes , i was so happy with them that i would of given them a 5 star ... .until 6 months ago . all of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half ( these dishes are microwave safe , and no children ) all have broken in the same place ... 2 broke when picking up , 4 have broken while microwaving yet all my cups , bowls , salad , square plates are still in perfect condition.. but without my dinner plates , my set ( s ) are useless ! ! ||| 0

i had to replace a heart waffle maker as my grand kids love nana 's heart waffles and i had taken it to the beach and left it there . they know nana 's heart waffles are the best as they come from her heart . i love this one even more than the last . it has great controls that make the perfect waffle . clean up is a breeze and it is cute ! ||| 1
i should have paid more attention to the reviews ... i was warned ahead of time that this crate should n't be used as an everyday or long-term solution . we 've been using the crate for less than three months and already the zipper one one end ( that we use all the time ) is screwed up and half the time it does n't open . at least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out , but i 'm afraid of the morning when i try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck . ( we leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in . when she gets a little older , we will leave her in her crate all day . ) we could still use the zippers on the top , but we do n't like those since the dog ca n't get in and out at her leisure . although in general it 's a nice crate , i probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers -- hence the two stars . i am completely surprised that we only got three months ' use out of it before the zippers bit the dust . we 've already purchased a different , sturdier , latch-style crate that we 're much happier with ... and we should have bought to start with ||| 0
a couple of days ago i depressed the switch to begin toasting a piece of sliced bread , when all at once a blue flash jumped out at me , thus causing the demise of my applicance . i now realize i paid far too much for this unsafe piece of junk that lasted about two weeks short of a year ||| 0
the price was excellent . ordering was quick and easy . delivery was prompt . the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen . they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle . ||| 1
we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years . they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine . i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below , but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together , not just by the handle . fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand . ( they are made like hotel china , essentially . homer laughlin is a hotel china company , in fact . the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line . ) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style , i can recommend the fiestaware `` jumbo cups . '' we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee , but also for heating soup in the microwave . they are both great . never been disappointed with fiestaware ||| 1

i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best . only problem is that they rust ! ! ! i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior . i do n't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot , so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times . the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so , but any serious tea drinker like me knows that 's unrealistic . i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money did n't last long at all . i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i 'm officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot ||| 0
this soup pot is an excellent addition to any cook 's set of tools . using this pot , there 's no need to saute meats of veggies in one place and then transfer them to an ovenproof pot to finish . it goes easily from stovetop or oven to the table and is compatible with almost any dinnerware . can you tell i really like my new soup pot ||| 1
the metal side arms that the drawer slides down on were binding and need some lubrication . somewhat flimsy . i do not expect it to last long . nice concept , but i wish they had used better materials ||| 0

i baked six loaves in this machine . i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things do n't turn out just right . my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures . even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time ( 70 minutes ) , my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked . i was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe . the machine was quiet , strong , and had a lot of bells and whistles , but with only partially baked bread , i had to return it to amazon . amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived , but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back , and were quick enough with the refund ||| 0

i bought this and used it once . right from the begining i could tell this was a shotty product . i do n't know who designed the wringing fuction but it does n't work in the least . and the removeable cleaning head would not stay attached half the time and i assure you it was inserted correctly . waste of money ! ! ||| 0

most importantly , this is small . this is the same size as one-person clay pot rice or bibimbap . it is the size of a deep rich fancy curry takeout . one cup of steel cut oatmeals will fill up the pot upon expansion . i have no regrets ordering this size because this is much easier to tote around . now that i have received my shipment , i know a yellow one with a brass knob would have been gorgeous but i have grown to prefer the red . it 's so pretty . it did n't arrive chipped or anything so there 's not much to say about how it works . just keep the heat between medium to low . i broke it in by making hot milk ( from powder ) with banana so yeah , as a pot , it heats stuff up . no leaks . p.s . one good thing about breaking in the cocotte with white liquid instead of clear water is that i saw two floating black segments that may have been pieces of the coating - yes i did wash the cocotte in sudsy water before breaking it in . i still do n't know where those chips off of the 5 quart are now but i hope they are at least not or no longer in our bodies . i think this try me size is a worthwhile purchase because it is light enough to lift up and tilt with one hand to pour into a serving bowl ||| 1
i threw out all of my old tupperware cups that my kids were using and switched to a supply of fiestaware ceramic cups . now that my kids are all over 5 , we do n't need all that ugly plastic . these are durable and attractive . a range of colors lets them keep track of which cup is theirs . plus , it matches my other dinnerware . it 's the perfect size for them . when they get older and need a bigger glass , these are perfect for juice ||| 1
for the price , i expected a quality canister . the plastic insert in the lid arrived unglued , and hardly creates an airtight seal . had i seen this item in a store i would have passed on it immediately . ||| 0
there 's nothing worse than having to find space for , and then digging out a small appliance every time you want to use it . henrietta looks terrific sitting on the countertop , and because she 's on the countertop , you will use her . she works great . will hold seven large eggs just fine for hard or soft boiling . i tried jumbos and she will only hold 4 jumbos at a time as they are fatter eggs , but seven large eggs at a time is fine with me . she poaches four eggs perfectly , and here , you can use jumbos if you like . the water reservoir is clearly marked and once you use her , if you find that your eggs are not quite done enough or too done , adding more or less water the next time will take care of that . actually , the first time i poached jumbos , i found that the eggs were still a bit too liquid for my taste ; i added a bit more water to the cooker , plugged her back in , and the eggs were perfectly done in about another minute . when the water evaporates , she chirps loud enough for even someone who is hard of hearing ( as i am ) . i love this cooker . first one i have ever owned . and because she looks cute sitting on the counter , i do n't forget i have her ; therefore , she gets used alot ||| 1

pros : i have two chocolate labs , therefore , i have a lot of hair to deal with . the vacuum works great and really takes care of the hair and dirt ( wood floors ) . it works alright on rugs . cons : not cheap . loud . the plastic clip used to connect the strap to the vacuum comes out so you ca n't carry it , you just have to roll it instead . not a big deal ||| 1
this item , affectionately named r2d2 , worked like a champ with all the bells and whistles , well , actually lights and dials for about 5 weeks and then just stopped . ... thus i 'm profoundly disappointed - and now without any grinder . in fact , given its short life , the 2 star rating is incredibly generous ||| 0
i thought this glass would be of better quality than it is . it took 3 shipments ( re cieved and returned ) to get my complete order without any breakage . these glasses are too fragile and in practice , impractical . because of the design , one must live with fingerprints all over the body of the glass . not too appealing when you are observing the `` legs '' of your wine . recommend that you pass these by ||| 0
seriously , for as good as their mixers are , their knives are really , really disappointing . flimsy , dull , easily bent and broken . within the first week of use , our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re-straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later . the steak knives are now following suit , and the handle of the chef 's knife has completely seperated from the blade . gah ! do n't waste your money ||| 0

i purchased the eureka filter bags with the eureka upright boss 4870gz for my mom . she loves them both . the cord is really long on the vacuum which makes it easy to do several rooms at a time . she lives in a one level ranch so she does not have to go up steps with it , because she does find it a bit heavy . beware the vacuum had to be assembled upon arrival . i live out of state and she had to get another relative to help her assemble it . the add never mentioned that small detail ! someone over 65 should not have to assemble a gift vacuum ! i bought the hoover wind tunnel 2 years ago , for myself and it 's a peice of garbage . the lever to keep it upright broke , the attachments fall off the hose when in use and everthing gets tangled on the roller ! i am thinking about purchasing the eureka soon , for myself ! i reccomend it ||| 1

we have tried a variety of knife sharpeners and they did n't work very well . finally , i purchased this item and we have been quite pleased ever since . friends even ask to use it . if you need sharp knives for cooking then this item is a great purchase . the cost may seem higher than most but well worth the quality and it really sharpens both serrated and straight knives . easy to use and nice addition to a kitchen where you enjoy cooking . ||| 1

i bought this kettle in february 2006 . i liked everything about it until its automatic on-off switch died recently - only two months after the purchase . now the kettle wo n't turn on . it was n't abused in any way , and these kettles usually last for years and years . the last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new proctor silex k4070 . i wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique ? has anyone else had one with a short-lived switch , or was i unlucky ? ||| 0
this fountain is a piece of junk . i ordered three of them , and all three had cracks and holes in the top piece . the top piece is a molded resin that is very thin in places . the thin regions easily crack , making it unsightly , interfering with the performance , and within days rendering the fountain unusable . i was very disappointed and ended up buying an entirely different fountain ||| 0

rarely does a product move me to write a review but i have found myself increasingly using the net ( and amazon ) to review products i am not really familiar with before buying them . rice cookers were one of those products . so i thought i 'd share my experience since i had a hard time finding a review for this rice cooker to help others out . we were microwave rice and stovetop rice cookers until we started eating a lot of sushi . then we wanted something to make the `` perfect rice '' . this is it . the first time we used it , i let my girlfriend make the rice . it boiled over and made a huge mess and came out totally mushy . i was bummed i spent $ 200 on a rice cooker that was going to be messy or difficult to use . then , i watched my girlfriend making it the second time and realized she was putting in 2 times the amount of water required . following the directions , the 25 or 30 times we have used it since , we get absolutely perfect rice . white rice , sticky rice , whatever . it is sylish so it does n't look like a little crock pot sitting in my contemporary kitchen , the cord retracts into the base for convenience and the thing could n't be easier to clean . the rice pot , the lid and the steam vent pop out and are easily cleaned . wipe the rest down with a damp paper towel and you 're done . so easy . rarely is `` set it and forget it '' associated with perfection , but in this case it is . would i prefer if it was $ 100- $ 150 , sure . but i paid $ 200 and do n't regret it . ||| 1
after going through several nathan 's cheap stovetop grilles . i realized , that although i love grilling food , i needed a good grill pan . i did not wish upon a star but a dream came true with this marvelous cooking aid . i use it evry day , it nrver sticks and the heat is so evenly distrubuted that everything comes out perfect ! it also is a handsome addition to my kitchen . ||| 1

i have been purchasing water at my supermarket and was spending more than $ 30 a month ! after we purchased this water filter , i can tell there 's little difference between the water i buy at the store and the water from this filter . i also feel confident if my daughters drink it because i know they 're not getting all of the bacteria and other hurtful chemicals and minerals present in tab water ! i recommend this filter . ||| 1
this item comes with many warnings as it should . it can be hazardous to use this heater with an adaptor for a two pronged outlet . the product itself is of high quality and runs well just not when you are in the process of renovating a house ||| 0
the heater works fine , but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet . delonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period . i will not buy an oil-filled heater again ||| 0
this is probably one of the best blade grinders out there . the top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup , eliminating the scoop step . it has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate , along with cup amounts . the amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on , however . anyways , bottom line : it grinds great with little mess . ||| 1
i bought myself one of these and used it minimally and was happy . i then bought one for my daughter . she used it about 5 times in a little over a year and it quit . the blade assembly as per other reviews . it is going to cost about $ 50 . to repair . now mine is smelling . i am using my old 15 year old oster and it is still working . also to my surprise it is doing a better job . just not as pretty . i have ka stand mixer , hand blender , food processors large and small , emersion blender and attachments for all . love all of them . will buy other ka but not this again ||| 0
loose shape and becomes literally towels within 3 months of use . total waste of money and shipping ||| 0
